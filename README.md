# Geek Alert | PWA-workshop

The **chat app** that we used to learn & flex our PWA muscles in this 10 hour workshop. 

The app uses:

* 🔥 [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for it's Database & server functions 
* 🚀 [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to add all the fancy PWA functionality
* 💾 [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for durable storage


Check out the finished result below and get busy coding 👊
